  Hereâ€™s the detailed `README.md` for your **Iris-ML-Project** repository:
# Iris-ML-Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying iris flowers into three species using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The Iris dataset is a simple yet powerful dataset often used for beginner machine learning projects.

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline that follows these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
   - Check for missing values and normalize the feature data.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Use a **Decision Tree Classifier** from the `sklearn.tree` library to train a model on the Iris dataset.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Dataset

The **Iris dataset** consists of 150 samples with 4 features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

Each sample belongs to one of the following three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Model

We use a **Decision Tree Classifier** as our machine learning model. The model is trained on 70% of the dataset, and its performance is evaluated on the remaining 30%.

### Results

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of approximately `XX%` (replace with actual value).
- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix shows the breakdown of the predicted vs actual species.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmithYallati/Iris-ML-Project.git
   cd Iris-ML-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have `scikit-learn` and `pandas` installed. If not, you can install them via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python ML_Project_Iris.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy (if required)

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with other machine learning models such as **SVM** or **KNN**.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for the Decision Tree model.
- Add data visualization for feature importance or decision boundaries.
